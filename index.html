            <p class="">
                Elon Reeve Musk born June 28, 1971 is a businessman known for his key roles in the space company SpaceX 
                and the automotive company Tesla, Inc. His other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company 
                that operates the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring 
                Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. Musk is the wealthiest individual in the world; as of December 2024, 
                Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$432 billion.In 2004, Musk was an early investor in electric-vehicle 
                manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), providing most of the initial financing and assuming 
                the position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, 
                Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. 
                In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit 
                artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing
                brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company.

                <dt class="text-2xl mb-5">Zip2</dt>
                <dd>In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed Zip2.
                    The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it 
                    to newspapers. They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[58] with Musk coding the website every night.
                    Musk and his brother's immigration statuses during this period were described by Musk as a "gray area", 
                    although Kimbal maintained they were working as illegal immigrants. A Washington Post exposé from October 2024 
                    reported Musk worked illegally while building the company, citing an email from Musk submitted as evidence 
                    during a 2005 defamation trial and the funding agreement from venture capital firm Mohr Davidow Ventures.
                    Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[49] The brothers 
                    persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[61] however, Musk's attempts to 
                    become CEO were thwarted. Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999, and Musk received 
                    $22 million for his 7-percent share.

                <dt class="text-2xl mb-5 mt-10">X.com and PayPal</dt>
                <dd>
                    In March 1999,[66] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with 
                    $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition. X.com was one of the first online banks 
                    that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation. Musk's 
                    friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for 
                    a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be 
                    straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived 
                    from it, such as "e@x.com".

                <dt class="text-2xl mb-5 mt-10">SpaceX</dt>
                <dd>
                    In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a 
                    growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[82] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim 
                    Cantrell, Adeo Ressi, and future NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin[83] to buy refurbished intercontinental 
                    ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO 
                    Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[84] and the group returned to the United States 
                    without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to 
                    look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, 
                    which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets. With $100 
                    million of his own money,[85] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and chief engineer.

                <dt class="text-2xl mb-5 mt-10">StarLink</dt>
                <dd>
                    In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide 
                    satellite Internet access, with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. 
                    A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, 
                    occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched. The total cost of the
                    decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be 
                    $10 billion. Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink 
                    blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.

                <dt class="text-2xl mb-5 mt-10">Tesla</dt>
                <dd>
                    Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. 
                    Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led 
                    the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, 
                    and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and 
                    oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.
